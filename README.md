# CS32
This is a repository for Introduction to Computer Science II (Algorithms & Data Structures) which I took in Winter Quarter 2020-21 with Profesor David Smallberg.

**Disclaimer:** this repository is for prospective employers to view my projects and ascertain my mastery of programming skills. Please do not make direct usage of
my code in your CS32 projects as that will violate UCLA's plagiarism policy and occur at your own risk.

## Projects
| Project | Brief Description | Spec |
|:-------:|:-----:|-------------------|
| [Proj. 1](Project%201) | 100/100 | Organize our text-based minigame from CS 31 into several header and source files, from the original single source file. |
| [Proj. 2](Project%202) | 86/100 | Implement a basic Set class using linked lists as the underlying data structure. (*Note: I only failed one test case out of 80, but forgot to finish my report and lost 13 easy points because of it.*) |
| [Proj. 3](Project%203) | 98/100 | ZombieDash: a 2D run-and-gun minigame. We were provided assets and basic driver code, and were tasked with implementing all the game logic. [Separate repository here](https://github.com/mppombo5/ZombieDash). |
| [Proj. 4](Project%204) | 82/100 | A genome sequencing program that utilizes a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) for sequence matching. |
