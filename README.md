# CS32
This is a repository for Introduction to Computer Science II (Algorithms & Data Structures) which I took in Winter Quarter 2020-21 with Profesor David Smallberg.

**Disclaimer:** this repository is for prospective employers to view my projects and ascertain my mastery of programming skills. Please do not make direct usage of
my code in your CS32 projects as that will violate UCLA's plagiarism policy and occur at your own risk.

## Projects
| Project | Brief Description | Skills Used |
|:-------:|:--|:--|
| [Project 3](Project_3) |Ghost Racer: A 2D driving video game set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with zombies. As the ghost racer drives down the highway, the goal is to save “lost souls” while avoiding various obstacles, eliminating enemies and collecting refillable goodies. Each level becomes more difficult as you have to save more lost souls to complete it while more enemies and obstacles spawn. We were provided with a basic driver and assets, and were required to implement all of the game logic according to the 57-page spec which can be found [here](Project_3/proj3-cs32-spec.pdf).|<ul><li>Object oriented programming to create all of the actor classes and avoid code duplication</li><li>Data structures to keep track of the game world</li></ul>|
| [Project 4](Project_4) |Console-based text editor with ability to: <ul><li>Load and edit documents of any size</li><li>Undo changes</li><li>Check spelling in real-time and provide spelling suggestions</li></ul>We were provided with a textual GUI to display the text editor and were asked to build all of the functionality ourselves while meeting big-O requirements. The full spec can be found [here](Project_4/cs32-p4-spec.pdf).|<ul><li>Data structures and algorithms to implement functionality while meeting strict big-O requirements</li></ul>
