# CS32
This is a repository for Introduction to Computer Science II (Algorithms & Data Structures) which I took in Winter Quarter 2020-21 with Profesor David Smallberg.

**Disclaimer:** this repository is for prospective employers to view my projects and ascertain my mastery of programming skills. Please do not make direct usage of
my code in your CS32 projects as that will violate UCLA's plagiarism policy and occur at your own risk.
